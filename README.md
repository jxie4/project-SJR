## About
  The 3 tabs introduces our research question, the data sources and the team members.

- [x] Research Question


    This page explains our research question in more details. This page explains the motives behind our research question. It includes all the indicators used in our study and explains how these indicators are selected. We also state the indicator used for political system status and explain the mechanism behind this score.

### Dataset sources
	An introduction to the two data sources and the providers used in our research: World Development Indicator by the world bank & Polity IV by Integrated Network for Societal Conflict Research

### Our Team
    	A basic introduction of the 3 team members: Shilin Liu, Juanyou Xie & Richard Han

## Key Findings
	Our data collected were presented in three different ways: country overview, indicator overview & political system & social development.

###   Country overview
  	This page presents the data for each country from World Development Indicators and Project Polity IV. Users can select whichever country they are interested it and get the data we have. The purpose is to help users get a general sense of each country's situation, including the social indicators and political system status.

### Indicator overview
  	This page provides the function of comparing cross-country data in one single indicator. The multiple choice form allows users to choose multiple countries; the drop down bar allows users to pick the interested indicator.
	The table section will present the data for the selected countries for the specific indicator over the 20 years.
	The graph plots the changes in the indicator for each country. Each country will have different colours.
	This will help users understand how each country performs in specific indicators while comparing to one another.

### - [x]  Political system & social development ###
  	This page contains the key answers to our research question: how political system status affects development.
	The page is composed by 2 parts: the result summary table & regressions between political system status score & the one single indicator.
	The regression uses the aggregated data of all countries over the whole time span, meaning each data point represents the indicator of one country in one single year.
