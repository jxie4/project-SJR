The data used in our studies come from two well-established datasources: <i> World Development Indicators by World Bank </i> and <i> Polity IV by Integrated Network for Societal Conflict Research </i>

<h1> World Bank Development Indicators </h1>
This data is published by World Bank compiled from officially-recognized international sources. World banks datasources presents the most current and accurate global development data availabllbe. It also includes national, regional and global estimate.
In the World Development Indicators database (and most other time series datasets), all 188 World Bank member countries, plus 26 other economies with populations of more than 30,000, are classified so that data users can aggregate, group, and compare statistical data of interest. Groupings are primarily based on income and on the regions used for administrative purposes by the World Bank.
For the current 2016 fiscal year, low-income economies are defined as those with a GNI per capita, calculated using the World Bank Atlas method, of $1,045 or less in 2014; lower-middle-income economies are those with a GNI per capita between $1,046 and $4,125; upper-middle-income economies are those with a GNI per capita between $4,126 and $12,735; high-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $12,736 or more.

<h1> Polity IV: Regime Authority Characteristics and Transitions Datasets </h1>
The Integrated Network for Societal Conflict Research (INSCR) was established to coordinate and integrate information resources produced and used by the Center for Systemic Peace. The following data resources were prepared by researchers associated with the Center for Systemic Peace and are generated and/or compiled using open source information. These resources are made available as a service to the research community. All CSP/INSCR data resources have been cross-checked with other data resources to ensure, as far as possible, that the information recorded is accurate, reliable, and comprehensive
Polity IV Project, Political Regime Characteristics and Transitions, 1800-2015, annual, cross-national, time-series and polity-case formats coding democratic and autocratic "patterns of authority" and regime changes in all independent countries with total population greater than 500,000 in 2015 (167 countries in 2015).
